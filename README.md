# GON-Detector

## Introduceï¼š

This is our first creative project. We use three CNN networks to do the glaucoma detection. Our dataset is based on REFUGE.

Inception-Resnet-V2, is based on python 3.7+ and pytorch 1.3.1.

U-net, is based on python 3.7+ and tensor-flow 2.1.0.

M-net, is based on python 3.7+ and paddlepaddle 1.8

Why we use so many deep learning framework? Because we are newcomers and poor, we want to learn more and use free GPU.

## How to use:

We are developing a website.

CNN code and website code will be released soon.
